## Prologue

You and your fellow adventurers have found yourself in an unfortunate position - no gold in your pockets and no work lined up to replace said gold.  However, you have found yourself in the city of Lumineux.  The city stands in a lush valley, surrounded by verdant forests and snow-capped mountains.  Within the city, you find folks of all sorts and all walks of life.  You recognize the city as a place of opportunity for you and your party... but also, perhaps, a place of potential danger.

You make your way first to the Hammer & Tongs, a large tavern near the Adventurers' District, where folks such as you often go to find work or a place to relax, indulging whatever vices you might partake in.  Within the sprawling main floor of the Hammer & Tongs, you see adventurers large and small, sharing stories and a mug of ale.

## Chapter 1: Jymrian

At a table of prominence, you find the Mayor of Lumineux - Jymrian.  While not of tall stature, he exudes confidence.  He's wearing adventurer's gear underneath a more opulent robe, signifying his station.  You realize that he must have come to his position not through back room politics, but by the acceptance and adulation of the other adventurers.  You have heard tales that he was a Ranger before taking on the mantle of Mayor - swift of foot and a true shot with his longbow.

Sitting next to Jymrian, retelling some story of heroism surely, you see Doomguy, famed barbarian.  Even sitting down, he seems impossibly large, wearing thick leather armor and a horned helmet, reminiscent of a demon.  By his feet, you see a large obsidian orb.  It appears to glow from a fire within.  From this distance, you cannot discern more about it.

"Hail and well met, adventurers," Jymrian calls as you approach his table.  "What brings you to my fair city?"

After a brief exchange asking for work, Jymrian insists that you prove your worth and challenges you to a race.  Shedding his mayoral robe, Jymrian leads you to the main boulevard.  With little effort, he bests you in a race, but he is impressed with your tenacity.

__Outcome: Random encounter failed.__

## Chapter 2: Claiming the Obsidian Orb (Thursday - 9/12)

Back at the Hammer & Tongs, you convince Jymrian to distract Doomguy for a moment, allowing you to steal the Obsidian Orb taking it out behind the Hammer & Tongs.  Why would Jymrian help you in this way?  What is the purpose of the Obsidan Orb?  And why did Doomguy just have it sitting at his feet?

__Outcome: Random encouter succeeded! Campaign RE-1: Aesthetics offered.__

## Chapter 3: Examining the Orb (Tuesday - 9/15)

After successful perception, arcana, and religion checks, your have discovered the following:

- Perfectly smooth and cold
- Flecks of white and silver across the surface
- A light seems to glow from within
- Called the Orb of Zoz'gathel, you know that it opens a portal to the Demon Realm, but you don't know how to activate it

__Outcome: Advantage for encounter next time.  No RE offered.__
